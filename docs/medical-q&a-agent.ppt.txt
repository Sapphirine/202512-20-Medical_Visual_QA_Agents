Medical Visual Q&A Agent – Project Outline 

Goal: Build a multi-agent system that can understand medical images and give accurate, explainable reasoning and answers.
Overview:
Vision – Medical Image Analysis
LLM – Reasoning + Fine Tuning
Agent – Multi-Agent Orchestration
Data – Big Data Analysis
Dataset: PathVQA [1]
High Volume
High Variety
1

Vision Module
🧩 Backbone Options: DINO / DINOv2 (ViT-L/14 or ViT-B/16)
Self-supervised transformer trained on large-scale image data
Produces patch-level tokens with strong semantic consistency
⚙️ Feature Processing
Input: pathology image → DINO encoder → [CLS] + patch tokens
Feature selection: Attention pooling / Top-K tokens → region-like features， Optional multi-scale cropping for tissue-level context
🔄 Fusion with Language Module
Project visual tokens → same dimension as question embeddings
Use Cross-Attention or Bilinear Attention (BAN style). Enables question-guided focus on relevant pathology regions
🧬 Training & Adaptation
Unsupervised training for medical specification!

LLM Reasoning

Medical understanding, reasoning, and answering.

Overview:
Language reasoning engine using LLaMa 3 /Qwen…
Combines visual embeddings from vision module
Lightweight fine-tuning on medical VQA datasets
Integrated into LanGraph multi-agent flow
Alignment Layer:
Alignment agent that validates 
each answer [2]

Deep agent Orchestration
Task Decomposition: breaks complex request into independent tasks
Parallel Fan-out: concurrently delegates subtasks to subagents
Subagents:
Vision Agent: analyzes provided medical images.
Literature Agent: retrieves and summarizes medical literatures.
Agentic Context Engineering (ACE) as Langchain Middlewares [3]
Generator = Agent: Executes tasks using current context
Reflector (@after_agent)
Evaluates trace: tool calls, task delegations, reasoning, etc.
Proposes strategy bullets
Curator (@after_agent): Deduplicates and integrates bullets into context (used in next runs)
System: Multi-Agent System with ACE Middlewares
